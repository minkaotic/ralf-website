Website repo for the site published under [sexuellebildung.org](http://sexuellebildung.org)

I created this site for a friend who works as a sex educator specialising in the ongoing development of sexuality throughout life, and whose training and workshops therefore focus predominantly on professionals who work with young people of all ages. , as they can get confused about kids' behaviour and traditionally it's been a somewhat taboo subject that nobody has helped eg. school or kindergarten staff to understand and to know how to appropriately respond to challenging behaviour, or even to know which sorts of behaviours are "normal" or which may be transgressive (edited)

Definitely resize your browser window or flip your phone on various pages, as the responsive element is the bit that took me forever! And other than my developer friends nobody else will ever notice this ;D
