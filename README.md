# ralf-website
Repo for the site published under [sexuellebildung.org](http://sexuellebildung.org).

I created this site for a friend who works as a sex educator specialising in the ongoing development of sexuality throughout life, and whose training and workshops thus focus predominantly on professionals who work with young people of all ages. 

This was my first ever website project, and I'm especially chuffed about its responsive design, which applies various adaptations to the different pages as required by the design, uses a mobile first approach, and as a first-time-practice took *a bloody long time* to finish off :blush:.
