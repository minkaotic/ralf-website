# ralf-website
Repo for the site published under [sexuellebildung.org](http://sexuellebildung.org).

I created this site for a friend who is a sex educator specialising in the continuous development of sexuality through all life stages, and whose training and workshops currently focus predominantly on professionals working with young people of varying ages. 

This was my first ever website project, built to practice CSS & HTML skills I was learning at the time. and I'm especially chuffed about its responsive design, which applies various adaptations to the different pages, uses a mobile first approach, and as a first-time-practice took *a bloody long time* to finish off :blush:.
