# ralf-website
Website repo for the site published under [sexuellebildung.org](http://sexuellebildung.org).

I created this site for a friend who works as a sex educator specialising in the ongoing development of sexuality throughout life, and whose training and workshops therefore focus predominantly on professionals who work with young people of all ages. 

This was my first website project, and I'm especially chuffed about the responsive design, which applies various adaptations to the different types of pages, and as a first-time-practice took *a bloody long time* to finish off ;).
